Apache-Request-I18N version 0.06
================================

This module adds transparent support over Apache::Request for
internationalized GET/POST parameters.  Form field names and values are
automatically decoded and converted either to Perl's internal UTF-8 format, or
to another character encoding.

Since this module inherits from Apache::Request, it can be used as a drop-in
replacement.  (It is not a perfect replacement, though; see the manpage for
details.)  It can also be used in a PerlHandler directive, in which case all
subsequent handlers will -- if they play nicely -- automatically see the
converted names and values.
